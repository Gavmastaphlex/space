							<h2 class="side-bar-heading"> What are your fees? </h2>
								<p> 
									This is probably the most common question and one that is very difficult to answer at an early stage.  Because our fees are based on an estimate of the time we might spend on a project, and each project is different we need to know the total scope of the work as well as the extent of our involvement to be able to provide a fee proposal.  We aim to provide a fixed fee wherever possible which is broken down into different stages (concept design, developed design, etc).  As a rough guide our fee for a new home is typically in the range of 10% - 14% of the estimated construction cost, however as each project is unique and varies in complexity it is best to contact us in the first instance so that we can talk through your project in detail and give you a more comprehensive indication of the fees involved.

								<h2 class="side-bar-heading"> Where do I start? </h2>
								<p> 
									Start by compiling a brief.  This will help to clarify in your own mind your desired outcomes.  Make it as comprehensive as possible being sure to include all of your wants and needs.  If you have a budget in mind include that too.  Search for images that inspire you, make descriptions of your lifestyle, specify any particular furnishings that may need special consideration and anything else that will help convey to us the vision that's inside your head.  The brief often evolves as the project comes to life which usually means the project is even more exciting than you dared to imagine.

								<p> 
									Not much is free in this world anymore, but to come and talk to us it is!  If you wanted us to come out and talk to you in your home, there is a nominal charge of $150 + GST.

								<p> 
									At Space Architecture Studio, good design is our focus.  We bring a wealth of experience, passion and creativity to your project. If you already have a design and just need someone to document that for consenting purposes, we're not the partner for your project.  However, if you'd like to discuss the project and develop it into everything it possibly can be we'd love to talk.

								<h2 class="side-bar-heading"> What if my project isn't in the lower half of the North Island? </h2>
								<p> 
									Location is not a problem for us.  We're happy to come to you, especially if you live in Hawaii, however we're also well versed at maintaining good communication using skype and online updates while designing your project.  We then like to hand pick local colleagues to assist with overseeing the project during the construction process. You'll barely notice that we're not just down the road.  We have successfully undertaken projects from the middle of the South Island to the upper North Island.  We're very keen to expand our horizons!

							<h2 class="side-bar-heading"> What if we don't have a building site yet? </h2>
							<p> 
								If you haven't already purchased a site or existing dwelling we may be able to offer invaluable advice to help settle on the most appropriate for your needs.  There are a number of factors to consider to ensure the best possible outcome for your requirements.
								For example we can assist with the following:
								Identifying some of the site aspects and constraints - the local council requirements, site access issues, orientation, easements and legal boundaries, ground conditions, location of available services.  All of these influence the potential of a site and it can be well worth the small investment to have us assist in assessing the potential site or existing home.
